# OP Wallet UX Research Hub

This repository contains the research methods and results in the analysis of many wallets within the Optimism Ecosystem. This presentation of the user experience analysis is a bootstrapped Github repository that can be used for ongoing OP wallet quality tracking.

## Ongoing UX Data Collection and Reporting
This hub standardizes user experience research of Optimisim capable wallets. The hub enables user experience research and analysis to be ongoing as the canonical source of procedures, scoring criteria, and data collection regarding wallet usability. The goal is to evaluate as many wallets as possible within the Optimism Ecosystem and for evaluations, analysis, and reporting to be ongoing at regular intervals. 

Anyone can step in and complete a new wallet evaluation or update a wallet evaluation (where the most recent evaluation was over six months ago). This is a very beginner friendly task for new contributors. Please see the Contributor Guidelines in the documentation
